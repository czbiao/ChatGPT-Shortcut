# FAQs

## Why are the prompts in English?

AiShort was created to facilitate the use of ChatGPT for native Chinese speakers, but the prompts are in English because ChatGPT has better understanding of English compared to Chinese. Even MOSS, the first large-scale Chinese language model in China, admitted that its English responses were superior to its Chinese ones, so it is recommended to use English prompts (MOSS is no longer available to the public).

Using Chinese prompts may yield decent results, but when you input the same Chinese prompt again, the results may vary significantly. This is because ChatGPT's understanding of Chinese is different each time. Therefore, it is advisable to use English prompts for productivity-related tasks to ensure consistent output. Additionally, the responses generated by English prompts are likely to be in English. You can specify that you want a response in Chinese by adding "respond in Chinese" at the end of the prompt.

## Do I need to input a prompt every time?

In the API, you can set the prompt as a "system prompt" so that you don't have to input it again. ChatGPT will follow the instructions given in the system prompt.

In the web version of ChatGPT, if you haven't switched the main prompt, you can simply enclose the subsequent reply in quotation marks. This way, you don't need to input the prompt every time. However, if the generated reply doesn't align with the desired prompt, it means that ChatGPT has forgotten the prompt, and you will need to input it again to remind it. Furthermore, each conversation link is unique, so you can save commonly used conversations as bookmarks for future use.

## Chinese search delay

The search function is based on Docusaurus's showcase, and it has an issue with Chinese input method focus loss on PC. After providing feedback to Docusaurus, they mentioned that they will attempt to fix it and stated, "FWIW, you should not be using Chinese anyway, since the showcase is not localized." However, the issue has not been resolved. As a workaround, I divided the search component into two categories: mobile and PC with a screen width threshold above 768px. The PC browsing introduced the "debounce" function to address the Chinese input issue. However, this results in two problems on PC: the need to complete Chinese input within 800 milliseconds, and a shift in PC search refresh from real-time to an 800-millisecond delay. If you have a better solution, your feedback is welcome.

## Outputting false information

Although ChatGPT is incredibly powerful, it is not infallible. Sometimes it may generate false information. For example, when I needed to input hundreds of pieces of information into AiShort, I instructed ChatGPT to convert the data into a specific format. However, during the conversion process, I noticed that some of the information was incorrectly written by ChatGPT. For instance, a tag in the text was "movie critic," but ChatGPT changed it to "film critic." While this might not have much impact in the text, it could cause errors when placed in code. Therefore, when using ChatGPT, it is crucial to check its output content.

## Prompts not working well

All prompts are sourced from the internet and are regularly updated. While I have tested each prompt, the actual performance may vary depending on the specific requirements. If you find any errors, have creative ideas, or have good prompts to contribute, please feel free to provide feedback and submissions [here](https://github.com/rockbenben/ChatGPT-Shortcut/discussions/11).

If you are summarizing or consolidating information, you can use GPT to further refine the original answer and improve its accuracy. Moreover, prompts can not only be used for productive tasks but also help broaden your thinking, stimulate creativity, approach problems from multiple angles, and address issues that are easily overlooked in conventional thinking.
